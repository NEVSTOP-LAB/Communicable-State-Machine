## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues, suggestions, and requirements through ISSUE or DISCUSSION. Participate in discussions and share your insights.

### :two: Code Development

Submit code changes to the CSM framework via PR. Please note the following:

1. PRs should be associated with an ISSUE or clearly describe the purpose and content of the PR.
2. If the change is not related to an ISSUE, create an ISSUE first, then submit the PR.
3. Issues marked with [`help wanted`](https://github.com/NEVSTOP-LAB/Communicable-State-Machine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are a good starting point.
4. Besides the current REPO, you can also contribute to CSM plugins and examples. View all CSM-related issues through the [CSM development panel](https://github.com/orgs/NEVSTOP-LAB/projects/8).

### :three: Wiki Maintenance

CSM's Wiki is an open knowledge base, and everyone is welcome to help maintain it. Submit changes to the Wiki via PR.

### :four: Contribute Open-Source Modules, Examples, or High-Quality CSM Projects

Add the topic [`LabVIEW-CSM`](https://github.com/topics/labview-csm) so other CSM users can easily find your project.
